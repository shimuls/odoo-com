Absence Management
==================

Allows to set up intervals which can be used with the Task Alert module to create a task.
You can set up the intervals in the Human Resources Leave Types Configuration form under the Absence Control header.
To have the tasks created, it is required to set up a Task Alert or a Automated Action on the Absent Notification Date
field.
